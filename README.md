## I would like to say about but haven't mention in previous table

`/nvim/colors/dedsec.vim` - colorscheme I made and use. 

`scripts/clear_all_containers.sh` - bash script for destroying all containers and images docker see

## TODO

- [ ] add alacritty config
- [ ] add xinitrc
- [ ] make and add tmux config
- [ ] update `arch_update_playbook` so it will install all packages I need on all the arch based servers
